      (description "@code{Barrier} is software that mimics the functionality of
a KVM switch, which historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and
mouse to control multiple computers by physically turning a dial on the box to
switch the machine you're controlling at any given moment.  Barrier does this
in software, allowing you to tell it which machine to control by moving your
mouse to the edge of the screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a
different system.")
